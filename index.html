When you invite someone you trust you put your reputation on the line, but you also gain platform benefits including referral fees and a stronger status in the community as a Connector.</p></div><div class="component" id="marketplace"><img src="marketplace.svg"><h3>Marketplace</h3><p>As a Market Network, we strive to provide the staging grounds for the full journey from raw idea to finished product ‚Äì including all the steps in between, including micro-funding if necessary.
