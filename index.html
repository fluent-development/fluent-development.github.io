It is a distributed, flexible, virtual working environment, tailor made for <strong>co-creation</strong><sup>1</sup>, which connects the best people with the most meaningful projects irregardless of physical location, and takes care of the incidental complexity and overhead of running great projects with great outcomes.</p><p class="footnote">[1] Co-creation is when people come together with the primary purpose to make something larger than themselves, to join in a collaboration of creation and stand on the shoulders of giants.
