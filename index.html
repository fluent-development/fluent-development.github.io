But most companies still think locally and narrowly about their "human resources"<sup>1</sup>, forcing many to work long hours in environments where focus and flow and unstress is not a priority.</p><p class="footnote">[1] We believe that humans are not resources, and that with the aid of great processes and tools a person can do their best work from wherever they feel they can do their best work.</p><p class="paragraph">We believe that humans are not resources, and that with the aid of great processes and tools a person can do their best work from wherever they feel they can do their best work.</p><p class="footnote">[2] We believe that humans are not resources, and that with the aid of great processes and tools a person can do their best work from wherever they feel they can do their best work.</p><p class="paragraph">Fluent aims to build the platform to facilitate this future workplace.

The Fluent Network is a global & strongly linked graph of the best people, connected through truly meaningful recommendations. This is how we can help to build your own Virtual Team in a fraction of the time and cost. When you invite someone you trust you put your reputation on the line, but you also gain platform benefits including referral fees and a stronger status in the community as a Connector.</p></div><div class="component" id="marketplace"><img src="marketplace.svg"><div class="title">Marketplace</div><p>As a Market Network, we strive to provide the staging grounds for the full journey from raw idea to finished product – including all the steps in between, including micro-funding if necessary. Think of a Kickstarter for projects.</p></div><div class="component" id="process"><img src="process.svg"><div class="title">Process</div><p>The Fluent Process is our roadmap from start to finish that makes sure a project outcome has the best chance of success. It starts with the first Raw Idea Workshops with the Client, moves on to Shaping, and then Building where it all comes together.</p><p>And with our platform support for Contracts & Escrow (guaranteed payment for delivered and accepted work), the boring and time-consuming overhead busywork that plagues most teams (and particularly individual freelancers) is optimised away.</p></div></div></body></html>
